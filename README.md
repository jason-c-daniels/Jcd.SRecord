# Jcd.SRecord
This library will load, parse and validate a motorola sRecord 
file according to the [Ubuntu srec manpage](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man5/srec.5.html) 
and the [Wikipedia SREC (file format)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SREC_(file_format)) article. 


Some inspiration was taken from reading the code by [Vanya A. Sergeev and Jerry G. Scherer](https://github.com/vsergeev/libGISdotnet/blob/master/SRecord.cs)
However, you'll note mine is significantly different.

## Examples
